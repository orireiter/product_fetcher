class Rabbit:
    '''
          A class to represent a connection to RabbitMQ server. 
          Allowing easier use of publishing and consuming messages with the same object, giving the object modularity.

          Attributes
          ----------
          rabbit_parameters: pika.ConnectionParameters
                An object containing parameters such as hostname
                of rabbit server or credentials to connect.
                These are defined upon creating an object and are 
                used when sending, receiving messages.
          connection: pika.BlockingConnection object
                Upon creation of this object with the 
                use of the parameters above, 
                a connection to RabbitMQ server is made.
                Allowing to create a channel.
          channel: connection.channel
                Upon execution, the channel can be used to 
                declare/delete queues, publish/consume messages and more.
          channel.qos:
                Decides how theis object will consume messages in temrs of quality.
                IN THIS CASE it is used to tell the consumer to take 1 message at a time.
                As opposed to taking 10 messages messages from the server at once, and 
                still dealing with them one message at a time.
          callback_queue: str
                (Recommended to leave the default)
                The name of an auto-genereated queue, which is also 
                declared to the server upon init, that will be used if 
                the object executes send_n_receive.
                Meaning - The object needs to have a private queue to get an answer from.
          channel.basic_consume:
                Upon execution it will define the properties of the consumption
                of the private queue (for use of send_n_receive).
                When purely consuming without using the callback_queue, 
                this will overridden and defined again with the relevant queue.
          msg_id: str(uuid4)
                When using send_n_receive(), the message send is 
                tagged with this property, as well as this object,
                so when this object awaits an answer (which will be tagged the same)
                it will know when the dedicated answer arrives.
          response: None/str
                (For the use of send_n_receive) This attribute = None 
                until an answer with the right id arrives. 
                And then response = body of that message.

          Methods 
          -------
          declare_queue(queue_name: str, passive=False, durable=False, exclusive=False, auto_delete=False, arguments=None):
                Declares a queue to the server to be used later on.
          declare_exhange(exchange_name: str, exchange_type='direct', passive=False, durable=False, auto_delete=False, internal=False, arguments=None):
                Declares an exchange to the server to be used later on.
          close_connection:
                Closes the connection to the server.
          check_corr_id(channel, method, properties, body):
                Compares the ID given to the message sent, 
                and the one of message answered.
                If they're the same, self.response=answer's body.
          send_one(queue_name: str, message: str, exchange_name=''):
                Send one message to the server (doesn't wait for any response).
          consume_one(queue_name: str, func):
                Consumes one message from given queue, executes one function 
                when the message is consumed uses it.
          consume_many(queue_name: str, func):
                Same as consume one, but loops on consumption. so each time 
                a message is received the function is executed.
          send_n_receive(queue_name: str, message: str, exchange_name=''):
                Sends one message with an ID, and awaits the arrival of a message with same id.
                To receive an answer the consumer of the original must
                use receive_n_send_one/many. 
          receive_n_send_one(queue_name: str, func):
                Consume one message, execute a function with it, and return an answer
                with the same message ID.
          receive_n_send_many(queue_name: str, func):
                Consumes a message, execute a function with it, and return an answer
                with the same message ID. Keeps looping this way.

    def __init__(self, host='localhost', callback_queue='', credentials=None):
        '''
              Upon initialization, the object will connect to the server,
              open a channel, declare a callback queue, and basic consume.
              After that, each publish or consume will rely on those.

              Parameters
              ----------

                    The name of an auto-genereated queue, which is also 
                    declared to the server upon init, that will be used if 
                    the object executes send_n_receive.
                    Meaning - The object needs to have a private queue to get an answer from.
              credentials:
                    If you're not using the default user, 
                    you'll have to specify credentials
